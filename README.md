# Adaptive kernel fuzzy clustering for missing data

In this work, the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used considering the kernelization of the metric with local adaptive distances (VKFCM-K-LP) under three types of strategies to deal with missing data, Whole Data Strategy (WDS), Partial Distance Strategy (PDS) and Optimal Completion Strategy (OCS).

Step by Step to execute WDS and PDS strategies.
